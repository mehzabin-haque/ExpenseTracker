# ExpenseTracker
Welcome to our financial management application, crafted to empower users with prudent spending habits. 
With a starting balance of 100tk, our solution diverges from conventional spending practices, advocating 
informed decisions before utilizing funds. The "Save" option facilitates allocation of desired expenditures, 
automatically deducted from the remaining balance, promoting mindful budgeting and savings for emergencies or personal aspirations.

To enhance convenience, we introduce an alternative input method via a text editor, enabling users to
save and import spending records at their discretion, eliminating the need for daily inputs.

Our standout features include a user-friendly interface, delivering an exceptional data 
visualization experience through diverse graph options. Moreover, an engaging animation at the 
application's outset adds a captivating touch, setting it apart from traditional financial management tools.

Rest assured, security remains paramount, safeguarding user data, input amounts, and remaining 
balances with the utmost confidentiality. Users can trust our application for secure financial tracking and management.

### Implemented in Java
Our project serves as a comprehensive financial management solution, replete with user-friendly 
features, advanced graph options, and robust security measures. We are confident that our application 
will resonate with users seeking an effective approach to managing their finances with ease and efficiency.

Feel free to explore our codebase, contribute to further development, and embark on a journey 
towards improved financial well-being. 

### Happy budgeting!
